# Hololive Shop Price Comparison Tool

The [Hololive Official Shop](https://shop.hololivepro.com/) allows users to select different currencies for their purchases, which can result in price fluctuations due to exchange rates. This tool helps you compare the prices of items in all available currencies and convert them to Japanese Yen (JPY) for reference.

By using this tool, you can easily see the prices of items in all available currencies on the Hololive Official Shop, and compare them side-by-side. Additionally, the tool provides a convenient JPY conversion for each price and order by it after all prices are fetched, making it easier to compare prices across currencies.
